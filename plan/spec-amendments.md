# Spec amendments

Tracked divergences from the canonical spec (`02-SPEC.md` as uploaded with the original handoff). Each amendment names the section being amended, gives the new wording, and the reasoning.

The original spec stays authoritative for everything not listed here.

---

## A1 — Persistent workspace state (amends spec §2.3)

**Original wording (paraphrased from §2.3):**
> IndexedDB holds FSA handles, session state, query result cache. sessionStorage holds BYOK keys.

The implicit reading was "no persistence beyond `.naklidata` files + ephemeral session state." That reading was wrong.

**Amended:**
> Workspace state — sources, column assignments, notebook cells, settings, FSA folder handles — **persists across tabs via IndexedDB**, plus the FSA permission the user has already granted. On tab open, the previous workspace is auto-restored. FSA-folder permission is re-verified silently when granted by user activation, and a "Reconnect" banner is shown otherwise. `.naklidata` files remain the explicit, portable export.

**Why:** Asking the user to restart from zero each session is a non-starter UX-wise. The privacy posture ("data never leaves the tab") is unchanged — persistence is local-only, same origin.

**Status:** Theme 3 in `pending.md`. The scaffolding (`src/core/idb.ts`, `src/core/settings.ts`, `src/core/handles.ts`) already exists; the boot-time auto-restore is the unwired piece.

## A2 — BYOK key persistence (amends spec §4 Hard NOT #2)

**Original wording (§4 item 2):**
> No persistent storage of BYOK keys.

This was the right *default* but the wrong *absolute*. Re-entering an API key every tab is friction users won't tolerate.

**Amended:**
> **No silent persistent storage of BYOK keys.** Keys live in `sessionStorage` by default (cleared on tab close). Persistent storage to IndexedDB requires explicit user opt-in per key, with the UI labelling the storage state honestly:
> - **v1.1 default (option A):** "Remember on this device" checkbox at entry time, defaults OFF. When checked, the key is stored plaintext in IndexedDB on the current origin. The UI tells the user clearly: "Stored on this device. Anyone with access to this browser profile can read it. [Forget]"
> - **v1.2 enhancement (option B):** opt-in passphrase-encrypted persistence. Key encrypted with a PBKDF2-derived AES-GCM key. Each new session: user enters the passphrase (not the long API key) to unlock.
> - A "Forget all stored keys" action lives in settings, available at any time.

**Why:** Same-origin JS can always read same-origin storage; "encrypted in IDB" with an on-origin key (PondPilot's posture) is largely theatre. The honest position is:
- Default to no-persistence (sessionStorage).
- Allow opt-in plaintext with clear labelling.
- Offer passphrase-encryption later as an opt-in for users on shared machines or with stronger threat models.

**Status:** v1.1 sidecar work in `pending.md`. Option B is parked for v1.2.

## A4 — Data-plane / control-plane distinction (amends spec §4.1)

**Original wording (§4.1):**
> v1.1 adds remote-source mounting: Public URL mount, public data catalog, Private bucket via Relay (Cloudflare Worker URL signing).

This framed v1.1's remote-source story as a single capability ("private bucket reads"). It conflated *where the bytes live* with *where the queries execute*.

**Amended:**
> NakliData's architecture has two planes:
>
> - **Control plane** — the UI, SQL editor, schema panel, taxonomy, classification, and action sinks. Always runs in the browser tab. This is what NakliData *is*.
> - **Data plane** — where bytes live and where queries execute. NakliData supports three data-plane modes; a single session can mix them:
>   1. **Browser-DuckDB** (v1.0, shipped) — DuckDB-wasm in the same browser tab. Best for small data, local-mount workflows.
>   2. **Signed-URL Relay** (v1.1, spec §4.1 + §4.2) — Stateless Cloudflare Worker signs S3/GCS/Azure URLs; browser fetches directly. Best for personal-scale signed reads.
>   3. **Compute Bridge** (v1.3+, see [enterprise-strategy.md](./enterprise-strategy.md)) — User-deployed binary running inside the customer's VPC. Browser becomes thin client over Arrow Flight / HTTP. Bytes never leave the VPC. Best for enterprise compliance, TB-scale, multi-team taxonomy.
>
> The three data-plane modes interoperate. Source kinds are tagged with which mode they use; the schema panel and sinks see all of them uniformly.

**Why:** Without this distinction, enterprise conversations devolve into "but NakliData doesn't fit my compliance requirements" when in fact the v1.3 Compute Bridge mode is being designed precisely for that case. Making the planes explicit lets us add data-plane modes (DB Relay, edge compute, etc.) without retroactively reframing the product.

**Status:** Documented across [remote-sources.md](./remote-sources.md), [enterprise-strategy.md](./enterprise-strategy.md), and [sidecar-architecture.md](./sidecar-architecture.md) (for the matching split-sidecar architecture). v1.3 Compute Bridge MVP is the implementation milestone.

## A3 — Project name and file extension

**Original wording (vision):**
> Working codename. Final name deferred per standing rule. Leading candidates: Nazariya, Lens, Prism.

**Amended:**
> Product name is **NakliData**. File extension for saved notebooks is **`.naklidata`** (format ID `"format": "naklidata"`).

**Status:** Done. Sweep rename committed (DECISIONS.md 2026-05-16 03:30).
